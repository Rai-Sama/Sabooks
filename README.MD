* I made this website as a mini project for the course "Web Design Lab" in semester 4 of B.E. (the login/signup page was not made by me but by other members of my team)

* You can find the website deployed <a href="https://sabooks.netlify.app/">here</a>.

* It is a simple study portal for students (School students and Undergraduates preparing for Higher studies).

* The website was built for the purpose of understanding web designing concepts using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is interactive but not dynamic i.e. the login/signup page is a static dummy.


*NOTE*

* Website was only for the course and is not maintained; some parts may have broken.

* Download links for all NCERT books is given but downloading by clicking on the link may not work anymore due to security updates to browsers. (Pasting the link in a new tab will still work)

* Books, video lectures and login/signup pages were made by team mates and have not been maintained at all.

* The exam pages like CLAT and GATE may have broken due to official website moving every year.
