* I made this website as a mini project for the course "Web Design Lab" in semester 4 of B.E. (the login/signup page was not made by me but by other members of my team)

* You can find the website deployed <a href="https://sabooks.netlify.app/">here</a>.

* It is a simple study portal for students (School students and Undergraduates preparing for Higher studies).

* The website was built for the purpose of understanding web designing concepts using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is interactive but not dynamic i.e. the login/signup page is a static dummy.
